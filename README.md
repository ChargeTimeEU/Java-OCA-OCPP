Java-OCA-OCPP
=============

A library for the Open Charge-Point Protocol from openchargealliance.org

This library is made to support anyone who wants to implement a Central System or Charge Point that follows the Open Charge-Point Protocol.
Please note, this is a library and not an application, so there is no main method. 

The design is driven by test, which will ensure premium software that is easy to adapt and modify to your needs.

The library supports version 2.0.1 and 1.6 SOAP and web sockets.

Incoming request events are split into feature profiles as described in the OCPP specification.
I recommend that you download and read the specification from openchargealliance.org
